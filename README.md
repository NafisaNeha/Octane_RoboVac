# Octane_RoboVac
Alhamdulillah, It‚Äôs my very first competitive project at university level. Though it‚Äôs a very small one comparing to others. But it is the portrait of hardwork .‚ù§Ô∏èüò¨
Walton Laptop Presents MindSparks 22: An Inter-University and College Tech/Biz Competition
INTRODUCTION:
Android controlled octane Robo_Vac vaccum cleaner car.
Can clean dust, dirt & paper pieces from floors. 
Doesn‚Äôt have any sensors. 
Machine can be controlled by any android mobile phone .
User can perform actions like moving forward, backward, moving left and right by the means of command using his-her mobile phone app.
Our Robo_Vac can clean dust, dirt & paper pieces from floors.Can easily control the car by using a simple mobile app.Contains 4 motors for 4 wheels, an Arduino UNO, a motor driver, a Bluetooth module, and some extra components.Easy to control the speed limit with a simple touch.Can use this car for different purposes by simply modifying the code in Arduino. 
We have used two software to develop this projects:
Arduino IDE
Bluetooth RC Controller
Goal of The Project:
The main goal of this project is to solve our daily life problems. 
This project can make our life more easier then before, in cleaning. 
To inspire the young generation about electrical devices like Arduino UNO, different types of sensors, mechanics and robotics is also our goal.
